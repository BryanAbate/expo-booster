# Expo Booster

## Propulse your Expo (React Native= application with a minimal template.

A minimal template to propulse your Expo application with a state of the art tech stack:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

## Goal

The goal is to provide a minimal template for Expo applications in TypeScript. The template is meant to be as minimal as possible, just enough to kick start your application without having to write boilerplate code.

By using a very small set of features, this template aims to be easy to update so that latest packages are always in use. This comes with some benefits:

- Easily maintanable
- Easily extandable
- Suits most needs
